To perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive insights from the dataset.

**Steps Involved**:
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Summary statistics and visualizations  

**Tools Used**:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter / Colab notebooks  

**Files**:
- Notebook: [`EDA.ipynb`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)  
- Cleaned Dataset: [`mg_cars_mumbai.csv`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/DataSets/mg_cars_mumbai.csv)
