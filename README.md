# Evoastra Internship - Data Analysis Projects


## Overview
This repository contains hands-on projects completed during my internship at **Evoastra**. The experience involved working remotely with a team of interns to build real-world data solutions, focusing on scraping, cleaning, and analyzing datasets.

## Internship Highlights


- Remote-first collaborative learning environment  
- Individual and team-based task execution  
- Practical exposure to real-world data projects
  
## Project Structure

### Task 1: Mini Project – Web Scraping of MG Cars (Cars24)

**Objective**  
To scrape used MG car listings from [Cars24](https://www.cars24.com/buy-used-mg-cars-mumbai/) for data analysis.

- Manufacture Year  
- Car Title  
- Variant  
- Kilometers Driven  
- Fuel Type  
- Transmission  
- Ownership Type  
- Price  
- Location  

**Tools Used**:
- Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests  
- Pandas for data storage and formatting  

**Files**:
- Notebook: [`EDA.ipynb`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/Task%201/Mini%20Project/EDA.ipynb)  
- Raw Dataset: [`mg_cars_mumbai_raw.csv`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/Task%201/Mini%20Project/mg_cars_mumbai_raw.csv)

### Task 2: Major Project – Data Analysis

**Objective**  
To perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive insights from the dataset.

**Steps Involved**:
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Summary statistics and visualizations  

**Tools Used**:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter / Colab notebooks  

**Files**:
- Notebook: [`EDA.ipynb`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)  
- Cleaned Dataset: [`mg_cars_mumbai.csv`](https://github.com/Vivekdesai25/Evoastra_Internship/blob/main/DataSets/mg_cars_mumbai.csv)
